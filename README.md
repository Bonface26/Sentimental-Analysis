# Sentimental-Analysis
As per the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 46.4% of the world population is still offline even though majority lives in areas covered by 3G and 4G connectivity while some 11% live in regions with no connectivity at all. Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa contributes to the largest region with no connectivity at all. In this project, we set to understand the high level direction on broadband Internet connectivity in relation to Africa and the degree at which African scholars are contributing to the research on the same. This is done through sentimental analysis using machine learning techniques.
